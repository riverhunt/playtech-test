1. Fix the path to you chromedriver in /test/resources/conf.properties
2. Test data is in testdata.json file. You can change/add something, if you like.
Just don't remove any fields and don't change values formats or it wont parse properly anymore.
3. Run test from RunTestng file if you want reports
